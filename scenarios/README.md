# Blockchain Benchmarking Framework (BBF) Research Overview

## Introduction

The aim of this research was to design and test a **BBF** capable of assessing the performance metrics of diverse blockchain protocols under varied conditions. This was achieved through rigorous research, developing a comprehensive set of metrics and evaluation methodologies for an in-depth analysis of different blockchain clients.

## Use Cases

The BBF was rigorously tested with two distinct blockchain clients:

1. **XRPL Client**
   - Focus on performance under standard operations and adversarial conditions.
   - Simulated Byzantine faults, including a double-spend attack and node failures.
   - Results highlighted XRPL's robustness and ability to defend against double-spend attacks.

2. **Ethereum Client**
   - Involved setting up a private Ethereum network.
   - Simulated double-spend attacks and induced node crashes.
   - Analysis revealed Ethereum's resilience, despite performance discrepancies under certain conditions.

## Key Findings

- **Versatility and Effectiveness**: The BBF adapted to each blockchain client's unique requirements, providing insightful results for meaningful comparisons.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: The framework excelled in capturing multiple facets of blockchain performance, including transaction times, network resilience, and performance impact under varying conditions.
- **Adaptability**: The BBF's design allows for easy adaptation to assess other blockchain protocols, showcasing its versatility and user-friendliness.

## Conclusion

Across both use case studies, the BBF demonstrated its effectiveness and adaptability. It stands as a comprehensive tool for assessing and comparing the performance of various blockchain protocols, contributing significantly to the field of blockchain technology research.
